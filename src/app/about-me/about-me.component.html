           <p>I'm a web developer skilled in <strong>frontend JavaScript frameworks</strong> including <strong>Angular &amp; Angular 2, JS, CSS, HTML, mobile development, Illustrator and Photoshop</strong> and currently work as a <strong>UI Developer</strong> at Penn Foster. Iâ€™m not located in any particular city because I work remotely- something that has increased the efficiency and speed of my work tenfold.</p>

         <p> I love achieving goals I set for myself both in learning new JS frameworks, new programming languages, Illustrator and design concepts. Small steps, consistency, &amp; practice are keys to progress and expertise. In ten years, I hope to be an expert at the full spectrum of web development and design. Outside of web development, I relax by practicing and progressing at yoga, weight training, paddle boarding and visiting as many national parks as I can.</p>
